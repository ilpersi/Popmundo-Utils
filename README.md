# Popmundo Utils

## What is Popmundo Utils?
Popmundo is a Google Chrome extension for the web-based [popmundo](https://www.popmundo.com) game.
It is a non-instrusive extension that can be simply installed from the Chrome web store and it will add some useful feature that will improve your quality of life while playing.

## Why Popmundo Utils?
Back in 2007, when it was initally released, I used to be an avid Popmundo player and I remember I always using an amazing extension for the Firefox browser (called popomungo)

After a very long break, I started playing popmundo again and I really missed some of the features that were originally available with the popmungo extension and the more close thing I could find is the [chromemundo](https://github.com/lahunoxnaakal/chromomundo) extension that has not been updated for many years and it is no longer working.

Rather that making chromemungo work again, I decided to create my own extension with a limited set of features that I like. This way I can have the features I miss and get some experience with Chrome Extension development eco-system.

## Features
At the time of writing the number of features is quite limited. However, as long as I play it is my intention to add new features and evolve the existing ones:

- Searchable Tables: everywhere in the game, when possible table are searchable
- Move to Locale shortcut: on every locale link, you'll have a small icon that will allow you to move that locale with just one simple click
- Numeric Grades: anything related to scores will have a better graphic appearance
- Progress Percentage: all the progress bar will have the percentage as a text so that you do not have to mouse over to get the value
- Skill pop-up preview: available in skills page and in your diary. If you hoover your mouse on the skill link, a small pop-up will be displayed showing recent learning history
- Character pop-up: whenever you hoover a character name, a handy pop-up is diplayed with the main info about that player
- Song pop-up: every time you hoover a song, you can get the main details about it in a handy pop-up. Very useful to check composing status or to know more about leading bands repertories.
- Open Houses DB: a handy database of all the known open houses available from the city menu. This will make it easier to find them from the city page.
- Login redirect: every time you are logged out, you will be redirected to the standard login page (without numbers in the URL), this will make it easier to log in if you use a password manager.
- Item reminders: *Only available for english locale* get reminders about items usage.
- Jam Helper: Select all the non 100% jammed songs in one click from your repertorie

There are also a couple of more features that should be considered as BETA:

- Call all friends: call all your friends in one easy click.
- Mass interact: random interact with all the characters present is a locale
