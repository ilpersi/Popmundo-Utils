# Popmundo Utils

## What is Popmundo Utils?
Popmundo is a Google Chrome extension for the web-based [popmundo](https://www.popmundo.com) game.
It is a non-instrusive extension that can be simply installed from the Chrome web store and it will add some useful feature that will improve your quality of life while playing.

## Why Popmundo Utils?
Back in 2007, when it was initally release I used to be an avid popmundo player and I remember always using an amazing extension for the Firefox browser (called poppmundo)

After a very long break, I started playing popmundo again and I really missed some of the features that were originally available with the popmungo and the more close thing I could find is the [chromemundo](https://github.com/lahunoxnaakal/chromomundo) extension that has not been updated for many years and it is no longer working.

Rather that making chromemungo work again, I decided to create my own extension with a limited set of features that I like. This way I can have the features I miss and get some experience with Chrome Extension eco-system.

## Features
At the time of writing the number of features is quite limited. However, as long as I play it is my intention to add new features and evolve the existing ones:

- Searchable Tables: everywhere in the game, when possible table are searchable
- Move to Locale shortcut: on every locale link, you'll have a small icon that will allow you to move that locale with just one simple click
- Numeric Grades: anything related to scores will have a better graphic appearance
- Progress Percentage: all the progress bar will have the percentage as a text so that you do not have to mouse over to get the value
- Skill pop-up preview: available in skills page and in your diary. If you hoover your mouse on the skill link, a small pop-up will be displayed showing recent learning history

## How to contribute
I am happy to add new features or to review any pull request. Before sending new features please let's discuss about it.
