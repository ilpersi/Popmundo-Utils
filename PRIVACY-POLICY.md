# Popmundo Utils Privacy Policy


## Data Collection

Popmundo Utils is not collecting any data at all. Since no data is collected, it stands to reason, and is, indeed, the case, that none of your data can be sold to third parties.

That being said, there are a few other ways your data is used.

## Chrome Storage API

Popmundo Utils takes advantage of [Google Chrome's Storage API](https://developers.chrome.com/extensions/storage) to store user options whenever they are explicitly changed by the user. Popmundo Utils is making use of the [storage.sync](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/#property-sync) area. If syncing is enabled, the data is synced to any Chrome browser that the user is logged into. If disabled, it behaves like storage.local. When the browser is offline, Chrome stores the data locally and resumes syncing when it's back online.
